# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is one of the most important topic in computer science that every CS student must be proficient in and even non-CS students must have basic understanding of it. It is said that DSA is like bread and butter, necessity of CS. This repository is made for those students (like me :sunglasses:) who are eager to learn and want to implement data structures and algorithms.

### Instructions

1. To get started make sure that you have python v3+ installed on your computer.
2. Once python is installed on your machine, just clone or download this repository.
3. Now `cd <folder-name>` into the folder where the folder you want to execute as a package is located.
4. Now run `python <folder-name>`.

### Example

Let's assume that you want to run files located in folder `stack`, then the syntax to run it would be:

```
cd python-data-structures-algorithms

python stack
```

### FOLDER NAMES

1. **queues** -
   - _simple_queue_ - Simple Queue
2. **stack** - stack

### Contribution

This repository is for learning how to implement data structures and algorithms, and since contributions of others won't really teach me how to implement it by myself, I won't be accepting any pull requests. However, feel free to fork this repo and modify the code to play around various data structures and algorithms. Moreover, while playing around the code, if you find anything unusual or wrong in the implemetation, I would highly appreciate if you create an issue on the same.
